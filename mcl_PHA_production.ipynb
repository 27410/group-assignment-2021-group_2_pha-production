    "Typically, the PHA is composed of monomers that are 2n (n ≥ 0) carbons shorter than the substrates added to the media. For example, growth of _P. oleovorans_ on octanoate ($C\\scriptstyle 8$) generates a PHA copolymer containing $C\\scriptstyle 8$ and $C\\scriptstyle 6$ monomers, whereas growth on dodecanoate ($C\\scriptstyle 12$) generates a PHA containing $C\\scriptstyle 12$, $C\\scriptstyle 10$, $C\\scriptstyle 8$, and $C\\scriptstyle 6$ monomers (Lageveen et al., 1995). Alkanoic acids present in the media are transported into the cell where they are first converted to CoA esters before being directed to the β-oxidation pathway where a number of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates can be generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the PHA synthase accepts only the R-isomer of 3-hydroxyacyl- CoA and the bacterial $\\beta$-oxidation of saturated fatty acids generates only the S-isomer of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, bacteria must have enzymes capable of generating R-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. One potential enzyme is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase, mediating the reversible conversion of the S- and R-isomers of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. \n",

Instead, the present hydroxyacyl as well as the added saturated fatty acids are reacting to polyhydroxyalkanoate only in the present version.\n",
