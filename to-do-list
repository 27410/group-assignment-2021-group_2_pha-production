to-do

aim: improve PHA production with Ralstonia eutropha H16 data using Cobrapy

ideas: N-limitation in media, 
- different type of PHA than PHB production, 
- anaerobic cultivation, 
- add different metabolic pathway (to e.g. enable uptake of glucose)

example from session 6 exercise:
- change medium

Examples of what other people have done:
    - calculate costs
    - change cofactores
    - change carbon source
