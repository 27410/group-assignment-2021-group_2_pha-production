# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 2 - Improve PHA production with _Ralstonia eutropha_ - Category II

## Project summary (<300 words)
_Ralstonia eutropha_ H16 is a Gram-negative lithoautotrophic bacterium that can utillize CO2 and H2 as its sources of carbon and energy in the absence of organic substrates. _R. eutropha_ H16 can reach high cell densities either under lithoautotrophic or heterotrophic conditions, which makes it suitable for a number of biotechnological applications. It is the best known and most promising producer of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from various carbon substrates.
