# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 2 - Improve PHA production with _Ralstonia eutropha_ - Category II

## Project summary 
_Ralstonia eutropha_ H16 is a Gram-negative lithoautotrophic bacterium that can utillize CO2 and H2 as its sources of carbon and energy in the absence of organic substrates. _R. eutropha_ H16 can reach high cell densities either under lithoautotrophic or heterotrophic conditions, which makes it suitable for a number of biotechnological applications. It is the best known and most promising producer of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from various carbon substrates. 
As substrate accounts for 30-50 % of the total product cost, multiple options for different substrate uptakes were added to the model. 
On one hand, glucose, glycerol and CO2 were added to the medium as the sole carbon source utilizing and improving flux to the existing pathway for PHB production. Successfull application in the laboratory could lead to lower substrate and therefore lower production costs.
On the other hand, different alkanoic acids were added to the medium as sole carbon source to produce _medium-chain-length_ PHA. The production pathways for these PHAs were added as well, as they require a different, heterologous PHA synthase to be produced. Producing _mcl_ PHA could increase the selling price, as the material properties are more comparable with crude-oil based plastics. 

Glucose, Glycerol and CO2 were used to produce PHB. The general idea was to substitute the carbon source that is included in the media with the new, cheaper one, to reduce production costs.

So far, no increase in yield could be achieved.
